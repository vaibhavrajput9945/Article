# How to Safeguard Your Home Interiors from Holi Colors and Stains
## Holi is a festival filled with vibrant colors, joy, and delicious treats, but once the festivities conclude, your home may resemble a canvas of abstract art! So, how can you partake in the Holi celebrations without compromising your interior decor? Here are some effective strategies to protect your living space.

1. Expertly Cover Everything
Shield your furniture, floors, and walls with old bedsheets, plastic coverings, or newspapers. Utilize shower curtains for doorways and dark fabrics for sofas. Consider this your home's protective layer against Holi colors!

2. Protect the Walls
Walls are particularly vulnerable! To prevent staining, consider the following:
Apply wax or Vaseline for easier cleaning.
Use plastic sheets to cover wallpaper.
Ensure that color-coated hands stay away from the walls!

3. Safeguard the Floors
Holi colors can adhere to floors like uninvited guests. Employ plastic sheets, old rugs, or floor wax for protection. Place doormats at entrances and provide disposable slippers for guests.

4. Shield Handles, Switchboards, and Mirrors
Guests often feel compelled to touch everything! Protect surfaces by:
Wrapping switchboards in cling film.
Applying coconut oil to metal handles.
Spraying mirrors with a vinegar-water solution for effortless cleanup.

5. Establish a ‘No-Stain’ Play Area
Select a garden, terrace, or backyard for your Holi festivities. Implement a strict “no colors indoors” policy—if someone insists on entering, hand them a mop!

6. Preserve Curtains and Cushions
Replace decorative curtains with older ones and store valuable cushions away. If they do get stained, clean them using a mixture of baking soda and vinegar.

7. Maintain Cleanliness in Bathrooms and Kitchens
Avoid messes by:
Oiling sinks to prevent stains.
Using separate towels designated for Holi.
Keeping disposable wipes readily available.

8. Post-Holi Cleaning Strategy
Address stains with the following methods:
Walls – A paste of baking soda and water.
Floors – Lemon juice or vinegar.
Fabrics – Cold water mixed with detergent.
Skin – A blend of gram flour, curd, and coconut oil.

9. Implement Holi Guidelines
No wet colors allowed indoors.
Engage in play within designated areas.
If you create a stain, you are responsible for cleaning it!
